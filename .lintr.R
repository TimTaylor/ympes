    # Description:

    #           'dplyr::filter()' calls are linted; and '"always"' means no

    #      'expect_true(identical(x, y))' is an equivalent but unadvised

    #      i.e., when 'x' and 'y' need only be _numerically equivalent_
    #      instead of fully identical (in which case, provide the tolerance=
    #      argument to 'expect_equal()' explicitly). This also applies when
    #      it's inconvenient to check full equality (e.g., names can be
    #      ignored, in which case 'ignore_attr = "names"' should be supplied

    #       op: Named character vector. 'names(op)' correspond to undesirable
    #           operators, while the values give a description of why the
    #           operator is undesirable. If 'NA', no additional information
    #           is given in the lint message. Defaults to
    #           default_undesirable_operators. To make small customizations
    #           to this list, use 'modify_defaults()'.
    #
    undesirable_operator_linter(op = default_undesirable_operators),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Check that the 'c()' function is not used without arguments nor
    #      with a single constant.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #
    # allow_single_expression: Logical, default 'TRUE'. If 'FALSE',
    #           one-expression usages of 'c()' are always linted, e.g. 'c(x)'
    #           and 'c(matrix(...))'. In some such cases, 'c()' is being used
    #           for its side-effect of stripping non-name attributes; it is
    #           usually preferable to use the more readable 'as.vector()'
    #           instead. 'as.vector()' is not always preferable, for example
    #           with environments (especially, 'R6' objects), in which case
    #           'list()' is the better alternative.

    unnecessary_concatenation_linter(allow_single_expression = TRUE),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Using an anonymous function in, e.g., 'lapply()' is not always
    #      necessary, e.g. 'lapply(DF, sum)' is the same as 'lapply(DF,
    #      function(x) sum(x))' and the former is more readable.
    #
    unnecessary_lambda_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Avoid unnecessary nested 'if' conditional statements
    #
    unnecessary_nested_if_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      The argument placeholder '.' in magrittr pipelines is unnecessary
    #      if passed as the first positional argument; using it can cause
    #      confusion and impacts readability.
    #
    unnecessary_placeholder_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Code after e.g. a 'return()' or 'stop()' or in deterministically
    #      false conditional loops like if (FALSE) can't be reached;
    #      typically this is vestigial code left after refactoring or
    #      sandboxing code, which is fine for exploration, but shouldn't
    #      ultimately be checked in. Comments meant for posterity should be
    #      placed _before_ the final 'return()'.
    #
    unreachable_code_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Check that imported packages are actually used
    #
    # Arguments:
    #
    # allow_ns_usage: Suppress lints for packages only used via namespace.
    #           This is 'FALSE' by default because 'pkg::fun()' doesn't
    #           require 'library(pkg)'. You can use requireNamespace("pkg")
    #           to ensure a package is installed without loading it.
    #
    # except_packages: Character vector of packages that are ignored. These
    #           are usually attached for their side effects.
    #
    # interpret_glue: If 'TRUE', interpret 'glue::glue()' calls to avoid
    #           false positives caused by local variables which are only used
    #           in a glue expression.
    #
    unused_import_linter(allow_ns_usage = FALSE, except_packages = c("bit64", "data.table", "tidyverse"), interpret_glue = TRUE),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Usage of '&' in conditional statements is error-prone and
    #      inefficient. 'condition' in 'if (condition) expr' must always be
    #      of length 1, in which case '&&' is to be preferred. Ditto for '|'
    #      vs. '||'.
    #
    vector_logic_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Check that the correct character is used for indentation.
    #
    whitespace_linter(),

    # Description:
    #
    #      Yoda tests use (expected, actual) instead of the more common
    #      (actual, expected). This is not always possible to detect
    #      statically; this linter focuses on the simple case of testing an
    #      expression against a literal value, e.g. (1L, foo(x)) should be
    #      (foo(x), 1L).
    #
