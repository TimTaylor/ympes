# ympes (development version)

- The old format for assertions (with the `imp_` prefix;
  e.g. `imp_assert_int()`) are now defunct and calling them will result in an
  error. Similarly the function `ages_to_interval()` is also now defunt. See the
  earlier 0.3.0 release notes for replacement details.

# ympes 0.3.0

- New assertion functions that do not require the `imp_` prefix and return NULL
  on success. Note that returning NULL means the new assertions are not pipe
  friendly but the implementation is slightly more efficient.
  
- The old format for assertions (with the `imp_` prefix;
  e.g. `imp_assert_int()`) are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.
  
- `ages_to_interval()` has been deprecated and replaced with the function
  `cut_ages()`. This has a slightly different API (see `help(cut_ages)` for
  more information).
  
- New function `breaks_to_interval()` for transforming breaks in to
  corresponding intervals (see `help(breaks_to_interval)`).
  
- **breaking change**. The `limits` parameter has been removed from both
  `aggregate_age_counts()` and `reaggregate_age_counts()`. It has been replaced
  by a `breaks` which represents the left-hand side of your desired interval
  bounds (i.e. the `x` value in `[x, y)`). Intervals no longer span the natural
  numbers by default but will begin from the minimum break input. Any ages
  below this value will be treated as NA.
   
- New function `greprows()` for searching rows of a data frame.

# ympes 0.2.1

Fixes a memory bug in ages_to_interval() that was highlighted via CRAN's
Valgrind checks.

# ympes 0.2.0

## Functions

- New functions for working with age intervals:

    - `ages_to_interval()` provides categorisation of ages based on specified
      right-hand interval limits.
      
    - `split_interval_counts()` splits counts within a age interval in to counts
      for individuals years based on a given weighting.
      
    - `aggregate_age_counts()` provides aggregation of counts across ages (in
      years).
    
    - `reaggregate_interval_counts()` which is equivalent to calling
      `split_interval_counts()` followed by `aggregate_age_counts()`.

## Other

The testing framework used by `ympes` has migrated from `testhat` to `tinytest`.

# ympes 0.1.1

Initial release of `ympes` which provides a collection of lightweight helper
functions (imps) for both interactive use and for inclusion within other
packages.
