This is a resubmission of a new release that accounts for comments from
Victoria Wimmer made on an earlier submission. In particular:

- I now used the Authors@R field to declare Maintainer, Author and copyright holder.

- I have improved the description to flesh out the purpose of the package.
  Hopefully this is now clearer but to expand here; In the longer term, the 
  package aims to be a collection of small helper functions (hence the name
  imps) that I find myself copying between non-CRAN packages and scripts
  often enough that it makes sense to finally put them in a package. Currently
  I have restricted these to functions whose implementation I am happy with
  but will add more over time.

Hopefully these changes are sufficient.

Many thanks
